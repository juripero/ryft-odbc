This directory contains the installation of the Ryft ODBC driver.

/lib - contains all of the libraries referenced by the Ryft ODBC driver 
components.

/errormessages - contains the XML error message source for all error messages
issued by the Ryft ODBC driver.

1. Download and install the iODBC Driver Manager for Mac OS X (www.iodbc.org).

2. Untar the Ryft ODBC Mac OS X Client tarball using 'tar -xzf 
ryft1_odbc_client_macosx-x.x-x.x.tar.gz'.

3. Navigate to the ryft1_odbc_client_macosx directory and run './install.sh' 
or optionally 'sudo ./install.sh'. If install is run as root, the Ryft ODBC 
Mac OS X Client files will be installed in the /usr/local/lib and 
/usr/local/ryft directories. If you are not running as root at the time of the 
install, the Ryft ODBC Mac OS X Client files will instead be installed in 
~/lib and ~/ryft. 

4. During the installation the odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini files were created for
you. These files are iODBC configuration files. If you preiously had ODBC 
drivers and DSNs installed, you must merge the contents of the odbc.ini and 
odbcinst.ini files with the ~/.odbc.ini and ~/.odbcinst.ini files. If no 
~/.odbc.ini or ~/.odbcinst.ini file were located at the time of installation, 
these files were created for you.

Refer to the "Ryft Connector for ODBC Installation and User Guide" for more 
information on installing and configuring your RyftOne ODBC driver.
