This directory contains the installation of the Ryft ODBC driver.

/bin/x8664 - contains the binary.

/lib/x8664 - contains all of the libraries referenced by the Ryft ODBC 
        driver components.

/errormessages - contains the XML error message source for all error 
        messages issued by the Ryft ODBC driver.

1. Run 'sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev unixodbc-bin unixodbc' to install 
the unixODBC components if you have not already done so.

2. Untar the Ryft ODBC Linux Client tarball using 
'tar -xzf ryft1_odbc_client_linux-x.x-x.x.tar.gz'

3. Navigate to the ryft1_odbc_client_64 directory and run './install.sh' 
or optionally 'sudo ./install.sh'. If install is run as root, the Ryft ODBC
Linux Client files will be installed in the /usr/local/ryft directory. If
you are not running as root at the time of the install, the Ryft ODBC Linux
Client files will instead be installed in the ~/ryft directory. If you did
not run ./install.sh as root, you will have to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
include the [INSTALL_DIR]/lib/x8664 directory.

4. During the installation the odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini files were created
for you. If you previously had ODBC drivers and DSNs installed, you must 
merge the contents of these files with the ~/.odbc.ini and ~/.odbcinst.ini
files. If you did not have a previous installation, you can copy these 
files as ~/.odbc.ini and ~/.odbcinst.ini. 

5. To use Libre Office Base on Ubuntu, you must also run 
'sudo apt-get install libreoffice-base' if you have not already done so.

NOTE: This installation assumes that OpenSSL components are already installed
in your Linux distribution. If the OpenSSL libraries are not installed in your 
distribution, run 'sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0'. 

Refer to the "Ryft Connectors: Installation and User Guide" for more 
information on installing and configuring your RyftOne ODBC driver.
